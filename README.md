# RSA-Algorithm
A Python Script to Encrypt, Decrypt with RSA Algorithm and Attack RSA Encrypted Ciphers <br><br>
You can use any prime numbers (up to 5 digits) to Encrypt and Decrypt using this script <br><br>
Also you can generate an Attack using "GenerateAttack.py" and Try attacking the Encrypted Cipher using "Attack.py". (Also up to 5 digits, cause for more than 5 digits it'll take a long time depending on your hardware)
